Bone conduction smart glasses files.

They are made from taking apart a really cheap pair of smart glasses stealing the bluetooth module and thin batterys. then using bone conductuin speakers placed by the temple to vibrate the music into ur head well instead of the usual small batteries.

This repository is for the 3d print files if anyone ever decides to make anything similar and its cool.

In the future when i have time in not bothered to learn how to make a mobile app but ill prob vibe code one up so that i can add in my own ai agents and stuff.
